<h2>Summary</h2>
Offensive Security Professional with 3+ years of hands-on experience in penetration testing, and red team operations. <b>OSCP</b>-certified and currently advancing in <b>malware development</b> to simulate advanced persistent threats.  
  


Successfully designed and delivered two enterprise-grade training programs (CPTP & CWASP) aligned with NCSC, CREST, and APMG standards. Led end-to-end penetration tests across internal and external environments, and built a 30+ machine cyber lab with Proxmox and OpenVPN to support realistic adversarial simulations. Skilled in engineering attack paths, exploiting critical vulnerabilities, and mentoring technical teams through high-impact training and hands-on simulations.


# Projects
<h2>Enterprise-Grade Offensive Security Training</h2>

These programs were designed and delivered to meet international industry standards, ensuring participants gain practical, real-world skills in penetration testing and web application security. Both courses were aligned with leading global certification bodies, giving learners recognized credentials and trusted methodologies.

- <b>Certified Penetration Testing Professional (CPTP)</b>  
  - Designed and developed the full CPTP course for [Tranchulas](https://tranchulas.com/).  
  - Delivered with official content rights from [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), [CREST](https://www.crest-approved.org/), and [APMG International](https://apmg-international.com/).  

- <b>Certified Web Application Security Professional (CWASP)</b>  
  - Designed and developed the complete CWASP course for [Tranchulas](https://tranchulas.com/).  
  - Delivered with official content rights from [NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), [CREST](https://www.crest-approved.org/), and [APMG International](https://apmg-international.com/).

<h2>Cybersecurity Labs & Simulation Environments</h2>

- <b>Proxmox-Based Virtual Lab Environment</b>  ![Proxmox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Proxmox-333333?style=plastic&logo=proxmox&logoColor=E57000)  
  - Architected and maintained a Proxmox-powered enterprise lab consisting of 30+ virtual machines across segmented networks, with snapshotting and attack-path orchestration for red-teaming and malware analysis. Secure remote access is provided via a custom [OpenVPN](https://medium.com/@bericontraster/step-by-step-guide-setting-up-and-troubleshooting-openvpn-on-ubuntu-24-04-513b2341934e) gateway.  

- <b>Custom Vulnerable Lab Development</b>  
  - Designed and deployed multiple purpose-built vulnerable applications and services to support hands-on training and realistic assessments, including:  
    - Web app exploitation (XSS, SQLi, SSTI, IDOR)  
    - Active Directory attacks (Kerberoasting, ACL abuse, lateral movement)  
    - Linux & Windows privilege escalation techniques  
    - SSRF and GraphQL exploitation scenarios  
  - All labs are mapped to real-world attacker methodologies and integrated into classroom and practical exercises for CPTP and CWASP.

<h2>Compliance & Enterprise Security Solutions</h2>

- <b>Enterprise Compliance & Monitoring Platform (Essential Eight)</b>  
  - Designed and developed a full-scale Essential Eight compliance platform that can be deployed in enterprise environments to monitor and detect systems failing critical security controls.
