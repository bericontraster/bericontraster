<h2>Cybersecurity Labs & Simulation Environments</h2>

- <b>Proxmox-Based Virtual Lab Environment</b>   ![Proxmox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Proxmox-333333?style=plastic&logo=proxmox&logoColor=E57000)
  - Designed a Proxmox-based enterprise lab with 30+ virtual machines, segmented networks, snapshots, and attack paths for red teaming and malware analysis, integrated with a custom [OpenVPN](https://medium.com/@bericontraster/step-by-step-guide-setting-up-and-troubleshooting-openvpn-on-ubuntu-24-04-513b2341934e) server for secure remote access.  
- <b>Custom Vulnerable Lab Development</b>
  - Designed and deployed multiple purpose-built vulnerable applications and services for hands-on training in areas such as:
    - Web application exploitation (e.g., XSS, SQLi, SSTI, IDOR)
    - Active Directory attacks (Kerberoasting, ACL abuse, etc.)
    - Linux & Windows privilege escalation
    - SSRF and GraphQL exploitation
  - Labs were integrated with CPTP and CWASP courses and aligned with real-world attacker methodologies.

<h2>Compliance & Enterprise Security Solutions</h2>

- <b>Enterprise Compliance & Monitoring Platform</b>
  - Spearheaded the Essentials Project, delivering a cross-platform compliance and monitoring solution within 7 months.
  - Designed and deployed a Python3 Flask backend with a scalable architecture and secure role-based access control.
  - Built a client-facing dashboard enabling organizations to monitor agents, generate compliance reports, and manage deployments centrally.
  - Delivered a cross-platform agent (Windows, macOS, Linux) to assess systems against the Essential Eight framework, strengthening client security posture.
  - Enabled real-time visibility and control, allowing clients to block agents, enforce compliance, and maintain oversight across employee devices.
  - Drove end-to-end development (backend, frontend, reporting, and role management), ensuring a seamless and business-ready product launch.
