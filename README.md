## Projects
### Enterprise-Grade Offensive Security Training
These training programs were developed to meet recognised international standards and equip learners with practical, real-world offensive security skills. The courses were aligned with respected global certification bodies to ensure credibility and rigorous methodology.

**Advanced Penetration Testing Program:** Designed and developed an end-to-end penetration testing curriculum aligned with standards published by NCSC, CREST, and APMG International, incorporating approved concepts and authorised learning materials where applicable.

**Web Application Security Course:** Developed a complete web application security course mapped to modern offensive and defensive practices, aligned with publicly recognised guidance from NCSC, CREST, and APMG International.

### Proxmox-Based Virtual Lab Environment

Built and maintained a Proxmox-powered enterprise lab environment consisting of 30+ virtual machines distributed across segmented network zones. The platform supports snapshot-driven attack simulations, red-team exercises, malware analysis, and remote student access.
Secure connectivity is provided through a custom OpenVPN gateway.

### Custom Vulnerable Lab Development
Designed and deployed multiple purpose-built vulnerable applications and systems for hands-on training and practical assessments. These labs include scenarios covering:

- Web exploitation (XSS, SQLi, SSTI, IDOR)
- Active Directory attack chains (Kerberoasting, ACL abuse, lateral movement)
- Windows & Linux privilege escalation
- SSRF and GraphQL exploitation

All environments were mapped to realistic adversary techniques and integrated into structured learning cycles and practical exercises.
